===========================================================================
The 1st International Workshop on Ethics in Computer Security (EthiCS 2022)
===========================================================================

Co-located with `the 7th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy. <https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/>`__ June 10, 2022.



Ethics in computer security research are increasingly
critical.Security research not only involves human subjects and user
data, thus is subject to ethics considerations, but also assesses the
security of computer systems by
breaking them (a.k.a offensive security research), which frequently
raises ethical concerns. Unethical security research would cause
significant harms to the society and in turn hurt the community.
Unfortunately, “Ethics in Computer Security Research” is an
under-studied area, and lacks clear guidelines and resources. The
best-known guidelines are provided by the Menlo Report which was
released in 2012 and covers only high-level principles. Many
institutions may not even have the ethics-review board, and major
security conferences have just started the ethics-review committees
in 2021. Ethical concerns are thus not uncommon in security research.
It is urgent for the community to provide ethical guidelines for
international researchers and enforce ethics as a discipline.
This workshop aims to provide an international forum for researchers,
practitioners, and administrators, from security and other areas, to
bring and exchange perspectives, lessons learned, and new insights
into the guidelines and practices of ethical computer security
research. As a result, it expects to generate new guidelines for
future ethical security research, to call for resources assisting
security researchers, and to raise awareness of even implicit ethical
concerns.


Scope and topics
================

EthiCS welcomes submissions on studies, proposals of protocols, reflections on ethics
in security research, as well as technical papers on protecting data
and providing controlled safe experimental environments. Both full
papers and work-in-progress short reports are welcome. The covered
topics include, but not limited to:

- Protocols for ethics review at institutions without IRB 
- Protocols for ethics considerations beyond IRB
- Modelling of threats and risks of security research
- Subject-consent management
- Implicit ethical concerns in security research
- Reflections and analyses on existing security research
- Approaches for protecting sensitive data
- Approaches for controlled and safe experimental environments

All papers will be published by IEEE and posted on the IEEE Xplore.


Submissions
===========
EthiCS encourages submissions of full papers and short papers from
academia, industry, and government. Short papers must be up to 4
pages and long papers must be up to 8 pages, including references.
All papers are in the IEEE conference proceedings format. Submitted
papers must adhere to `the IEEE S&P conference proceeding template <https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/eurosp-2022-template.zip>`__. 
Submissions must be written in English and typeset in A4 format.
We recommend using LaTeX, and suggest you first compile the supplied
LaTeX source as is, checking that you obtain the same PDF as the one
supplied. Then, write your paper into the LaTeX template, replacing
the boilerplate text. Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors
should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures
that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render
correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.



EthiCS will
accept anonymous submissions and apply a double-blind peer-review process for
them. Submissions must be fully anonymized, including submissions
discussing existing research or author’s prior research. All
submissions are expected to follow the guidelines for ethical
research and human subject research if applicable and address
potential ethical concerns. 

Best paper award(s), student travel grants

Papers must be submitted at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ethics2022 and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.


Important dates
===============
- March 21, 2022 (AoE, UTC -12): Paper submission
- April 14, 2022: Notification
- April 22, 2022: Camera-ready paper
- June 10, 2022: Workshop 

Publication and presentation
============================
All papers will be published by IEEE and
posted on the IEEE Xplore. At least one authors of each accepted
submission will register and present at the workshop.
Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication
clearances. 
We are expecting to hold an in
person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the
conference to present their paper, but will make allowances for
remote presentation in cases where all authors of a paper have
legitimate reasons they are unable to attend in person.
